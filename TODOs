@astro:

- voxel uses more than the vailable 112k RAM, still works, but may currupt things in the future (please check the return value of malloc if close to 112k)
- fix this warnings in sim build with gcc (no warnings with clang):
	../animations/gap.c: In function ‘tick’:
	../animations/gap.c:106: warning: will never be executed
	../animations/qr_clock.c: In function ‘tick’:
	../animations/qr_clock.c:31: warning: will never be executed
- fix this warning in firmware build:
	../animations/29c3.c: In function 'fillLeds':
	../animations/29c3.c:45:18: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]


@seb:
- hal directory in firmware and sim for file-layer, adc and eeprom emulation
